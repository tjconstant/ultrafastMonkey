\title{
Calculation of Incident Fluence from a Pulsed Laser System
}
\description{
Calculation of the incident power per unit area (fluence) from a pulsed laser system given various parameters
}
\usage{
ultrafast_fluence(power_mW = 1, 
                  freq_khz = 1.05, 
                  spot_diameter_microns = 100, 
                  beam_angle_deg = 60)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{power_mW}{
Average power in mW
}
  \item{freq_khz}{
Repetition rate of the laser system
}
  \item{spot_diameter_microns}{
Spot diameter at normal incidence in microns
}
  \item{beam_angle_deg}{
Incident angle of beam on surface in degrees. Used to calulate ellipsity of beam spot
}
}
\details{

}
\value{
Returns Fluence in 3 common units of measurement. Also provides a warning in relation to graphene damage thresholds [1].
